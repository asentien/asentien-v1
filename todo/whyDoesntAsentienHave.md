**Why doesn’t asentien have an iPhone or an Android application?**

I’m not, at the time of writing this, familiar enough with React Native to build asentien on it, but since the web application is written in ReactJS, much knowledge should be transferable. The backend is also a separate API, meaning it can be reused to serve the mobile application as well. The benefit of React Native, besides the similarities with ReactJS, is that the application you write, is applicable for both iPhone and Android, speeding up the development time. Creating a mobile application is our top priority, but with that said, I can’t provide an estimate of how long it’ll take. There’s an, at the present time, empty repository located at https://github.com/asentien/asentien-mobile-v1. 

**A way to support creators?**

This is something I desperately want to add. I want there to be multiple different ways, for us and for our users, to support and contribute to the people delivering internet’s promise. I have many ideas about how it can be done and I really hope it’s one day realized. It’s just a programmatic and an infrastructural question. 

**An edit button? **

It’s coming, but before we implement one, we want it to do justice to our users. If you share a post you believe represents something you approve of, we don’t want you to risk the post being edited to something completely different, making it seem like you approve of something you perhaps don’t. This is why an edit button would require far more than merely the ability to alter the content of the post itself which would take seconds to add. 

What we want is a solution that would allow each user to choose to either, clearly display the differences between what the user initially shared or commented on and what the post then evolved into, or allow the person to display the new and updated version if they so prefer. But it’ll take time as it would require us to keep track of the edit history of the post itself and when in that history each comment or share was made. Notify each user of exactly what has been changed on every post that they’ve liked, commented on, or shared. And It would also require us to conveniently display all the information to our users. All worthwhile and doable but only with time and greater resources. 

**A verified tag?**

This is a question of manpower, not programming prowess. We want a verified tag to represent a verification that the user is who they say they are and that their claimed qualifications, such as their occupational and educational status, are accurate. But to adequately confirm those details we would need people dedicated to the task, something we don’t have at the moment. 

**A messaging system?**

It doesn’t appear too hard to add a decent messaging system, but it would take some time since I would first need to better familiarize myself with both Web Sockets and Django Channels. Then write the code for both the front-end and back-end. Since I expect most, if not all people, already have ways to contact others it hasn’t been an ultimate priority for a project still in the alpha stage. But I do have a visual and functional design in mind if someone else is interested in implementing it. 
 
**Authenticating through Google or Apple?**

When I began working on asentien, the Sign Up details were slightly different and didn’t match other authentication services. This is no longer the case after I revisited it. This means that authenticating through Google or Apple would now be possible, it just needs to be implemented. 

**A way to add and display links to other sites?**

This is something I want to add, hopefully, sooner than later. But before I add a way to display links from other sites, I also need to create a list of sites that a user shouldn’t be able to link to. I deemed it to be too much work to do both for a project in the alpha stage. 

**A better tagging system with links and users?**

I’m stooopid.
