    <strong>Mission</strong>
    <br />
    Asentien's mission is to deliver internet's promise.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Open-source</strong>
    <br />
    Asentien's current codebase is open-sourced and can be found on GitHub. Here
    is a direct link https://github.com/asentien/asentien-v1.git.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Asentients</strong>
    <br />
    Asentients are users that have been either promoted by us here at Asentien
    or by one of our Accelerators. Asentients are allowed to create original
    posts and we hope to provide them with access to additional perks in the
    future.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Accelerators</strong>
    <br />
    Accelerators are users that have been promoted by us here at Asentien or by
    an affiliate partner. They can create original posts as well as promote
    other users to Asentient status. We hope to provide them with access to
    additional perks in the future.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Status</strong>
    <br />
    Asentien is in the alpha stage. We're therefore still finishing additional
    features and optimizing both the codebase and overall user-experience.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Plans forward</strong>
    <br />
    Asentien plan on adding proper hashtags, mentions, messages, multiple income
    sources for our creators, a mobile app, a creator's podcast, and more.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Site-wide rules</strong>
    <br />
    At Asentien it's not allowed to upload, share, or post, content or material,
    that aim to incite violence, is discriminatory in it's nature, is
    pornographic, is illegal, or is copyrighted.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Reports and rule-breakers</strong>
    <br />
    If you see a post or a user that is breaking our site wide rules, please
    report the post and contact us directly. If you're an Accelerator you can
    also deactivate comments, shares, and even other users, as long as they
    aren't, or are created by, fellow Asentients and Accelerators. Asentien will
    thereafter review the deactivated user or post and we may reinstate the user
    or post afterwards.

    <strong>Security and Bugs</strong>
    <br />
    We can't afford to pay any form of compensation at the moment yet we deeply
    appreciate it if you let us know if you've found a bug or a security flaw.
    Consistent and important contributors can in the future receive a badge to
    display on their profile.

    <br />
    <strong>Be aware</strong>
    <br />
    Asentien does <strong>NOT</strong> store a copy of your password. When you
    Log In, the password you've typed in, is converted and compared to a{" "}
    <i>salted</i> and <i>hashed</i> string in our database that is created when
    you Sign Up. This means that your actual password is never saved to our
    database because it's much more secure. We don't have your password and we
    will never ask you to tell us yours either. Nor are we able to find out what
    your password is and give your password to you.
    <br />
    <br /> If someone claims to be from Asentien and asks for your password,
    please don't give it to them, it's a scam and an attempt to hack you.
    <br />
    <br />
    <strong>Contact Us</strong>
    <br />
    If you have further questions, suggestions, noticed rule breaking behavior,
    or discovered a bug or a security flaw, please contact us. This can be done
    through email, support@asentien.com, through our YT channel
